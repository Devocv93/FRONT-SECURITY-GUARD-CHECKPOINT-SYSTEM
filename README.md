When you employ the guard tour system, you wonâ€™t need to use notebooks or keep track of an ever-growing paper trail for your company. Instead, security officials will scan Qr codes checkpoints and log reports with ease using a smartphone, each point might contain an incident and comments. Before that, the system administrator  will plan a patrol route that includes particular checkpoints where security personnel must stop. The real-time event data is automatically delivered to our web system and stored safely. Using a mobile device, each guard is in charge of their own work.
